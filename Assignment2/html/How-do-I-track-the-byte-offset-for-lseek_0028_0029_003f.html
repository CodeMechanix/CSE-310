<h3 class="unnumberedsec">How do I track the byte offset for lseek()?</h3>

<pre class="example"><pre class="verbatim">     >   We thought that it would be possible to have this number through the
     >   evaluation of the following expression:
     >
     >   seek_position = (no_buffers)*YY_READ_BUF_SIZE + yy_c_buf_p - YY_CURRENT_BUFFER->yy_ch_buf
</pre>
</pre>
   <p>While this is the right idea, it has two problems.  The first is that
it's possible that <code>flex</code> will request less than <code>YY_READ_BUF_SIZE</code> during
an invocation of <code>YY_INPUT</code> (or that your input source will return less
even though <code>YY_READ_BUF_SIZE</code> bytes were requested).  The second problem
is that when refilling its internal buffer, <code>flex</code> keeps some characters
from the previous buffer (because usually it's in the middle of a match,
and needs those characters to construct <code>yytext</code> for the match once it's
done).  Because of this, <code>yy_c_buf_p - YY_CURRENT_BUFFER-&gt;yy_ch_buf</code> won't
be exactly the number of characters already read from the current buffer.

   <p>An alternative solution is to count the number of characters you've matched
since starting to scan.  This can be done by using <code>YY_USER_ACTION</code>.  For
example,

<pre class="example"><pre class="verbatim">     #define YY_USER_ACTION num_chars += yyleng;
</pre>
</pre>
   <p>(You need to be careful to update your bookkeeping if you use <code>yymore(</code>),
<code>yyless()</code>, <code>unput()</code>, or <code>input()</code>.)
