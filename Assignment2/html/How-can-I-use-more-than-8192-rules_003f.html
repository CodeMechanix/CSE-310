<h3 class="unnumberedsec">How can I use more than 8192 rules?</h3>

<p><code>Flex</code> is compiled with an upper limit of 8192 rules per scanner. 
If you need more than 8192 rules in your scanner, you'll have to recompile <code>flex</code>
with the following changes in <samp><span class="file">flexdef.h</span></samp>:

<pre class="example"><pre class="verbatim">     &lt;    #define YY_TRAILING_MASK 0x2000
     &lt;    #define YY_TRAILING_HEAD_MASK 0x4000
     --
     >    #define YY_TRAILING_MASK 0x20000000
     >    #define YY_TRAILING_HEAD_MASK 0x40000000
</pre>
</pre>
   <p>This should work okay as long as your C compiler uses 32 bit integers. 
But you might want to think about whether using such a huge number of rules
is the best way to solve your problem.

   <p>The following may also be relevant:

   <p>With luck, you should be able to increase the definitions in flexdef.h for:

<pre class="example"><pre class="verbatim">     #define JAMSTATE -32766 /* marks a reference to the state that always jams */
     #define MAXIMUM_MNS 31999
     #define BAD_SUBSCRIPT -32767
</pre>
</pre>
   <p>recompile everything, and it'll all work.  Flex only has these 16-bit-like
values built into it because a long time ago it was developed on a machine
with 16-bit ints.  I've given this advice to others in the past but haven't
heard back from them whether it worked okay or not...
