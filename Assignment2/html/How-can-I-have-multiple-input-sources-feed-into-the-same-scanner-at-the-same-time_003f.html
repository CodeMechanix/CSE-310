<h3 class="unnumberedsec">How can I have multiple input sources feed into the same scanner at the same time?</h3>

<p>If <small class="dots">...</small>
     <ul>
<li>your scanner is free of backtracking (verified using <code>flex</code>'s &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-b</span></samp>&rsquo; flag),
<li>AND you run your scanner interactively (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-I</span></samp>&rsquo; option; default unless using special table
compression options),
<li>AND you feed it one character at a time by redefining <code>YY_INPUT</code> to do so,
</ul>

   <p>then every time it matches a token, it will have exhausted its input
buffer (because the scanner is free of backtracking).  This means you
can safely use <code>select()</code> at the point and only call <code>yylex()</code> for another
token if <code>select()</code> indicates there's data available.

   <p>That is, move the <code>select()</code> out from the input function to a point where
it determines whether <code>yylex()</code> gets called for the next token.

   <p>With this approach, you will still have problems if your input can arrive
piecemeal; <code>select()</code> could inform you that the beginning of a token is
available, you call <code>yylex()</code> to get it, but it winds up blocking waiting
for the later characters in the token.

   <p>Here's another way:  Move your input multiplexing inside of <code>YY_INPUT</code>.  That
is, whenever <code>YY_INPUT</code> is called, it <code>select()</code>'s to see where input is
available.  If input is available for the scanner, it reads and returns the
next byte.  If input is available from another source, it calls whatever
function is responsible for reading from that source.  (If no input is
available, it blocks until some input is available.)  I've used this technique in an
interpreter I wrote that both reads keyboard input using a <code>flex</code> scanner and
IPC traffic from sockets, and it works fine.
