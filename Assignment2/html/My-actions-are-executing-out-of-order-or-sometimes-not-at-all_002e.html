<h3 class="unnumberedsec">My actions are executing out of order or sometimes not at all.</h3>

<p>Most likely, you have (in error) placed the opening &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{</span></samp>&rsquo; of the action
block on a different line than the rule, e.g.,

<pre class="example"><pre class="verbatim">     ^(foo|bar)
     {  &lt;&lt;&lt;--- WRONG!
     
     }
</pre>
</pre>
   <p><code>flex</code> requires that the opening &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{</span></samp>&rsquo; of an action associated with a rule
begin on the same line as does the rule.  You need instead to write your rules
as follows:

<pre class="example"><pre class="verbatim">     ^(foo|bar)   {  // CORRECT!
     
     }
</pre>
</pre>
   </body></html>
