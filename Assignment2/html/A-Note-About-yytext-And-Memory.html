<h3 class="section">21.3 A Note About yytext And Memory</h3>

<p><a name="index-yytext_002c-memory-considerations-461"></a>
When flex finds a match, <code>yytext</code> points to the first character of the
match in the input buffer. The string itself is part of the input buffer, and
is <em>NOT</em> allocated separately. The value of yytext will be overwritten the next
time yylex() is called. In short, the value of yytext is only valid from within
the matched rule's action.

   <p>Often, you want the value of yytext to persist for later processing, i.e., by a
parser with non-zero lookahead. In order to preserve yytext, you will have to
copy it with strdup() or a similar function. But this introduces some headache
because your parser is now responsible for freeing the copy of yytext. If you
use a yacc or bison parser, (commonly used with flex), you will discover that
the error recovery mechanisms can cause memory to be leaked.

   <p>To prevent memory leaks from strdup'd yytext, you will have to track the memory
somehow. Our experience has shown that a garbage collection mechanism or a
pooled memory mechanism will save you a lot of grief when writing parsers.
