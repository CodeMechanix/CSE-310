     If your rule really has embedded blanks as shown above, then it won't
     work, as the first blank delimits the rule from the action.  (It wouldn't
     even compile ...)  You need instead:
     
     [:alpha:]([:alnum:]|\\_)*
     
     and that should work fine - there's no restriction on what can go inside
     of ()'s except for the trailing context operator, '/'.
