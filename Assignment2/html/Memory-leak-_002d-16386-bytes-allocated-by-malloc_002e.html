<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Memory leak - 16386 bytes allocated by malloc.</h3>

<p><a name="faq_002dmemory_002dleak"></a>UPDATED 2002-07-10: As of <code>flex</code> version 2.5.9, this leak means that you did not
call <code>yylex_destroy()</code>. If you are using an earlier version of <code>flex</code>, then read
on.

   <p>The leak is about 16426 bytes.  That is, (8192 * 2 + 2) for the read-buffer, and
about 40 for <code>struct yy_buffer_state</code> (depending upon alignment). The leak is in
the non-reentrant C scanner only (NOT in the reentrant scanner, NOT in the C++
scanner). Since <code>flex</code> doesn't know when you are done, the buffer is never freed.

   <p>However, the leak won't multiply since the buffer is reused no matter how many
times you call <code>yylex()</code>.

   <p>If you want to reclaim the memory when you are completely done scanning, then
you might try this:

<pre class="example"><pre class="verbatim">     /* For non-reentrant C scanner only. */
     yy_delete_buffer(YY_CURRENT_BUFFER);
     yy_init = 1;
</pre>
</pre>
   <p>Note: <code>yy_init</code> is an "internal variable", and hasn't been tested in this
situation. It is possible that some other globals may need resetting as well.
