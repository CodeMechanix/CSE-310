     Flex itself uses a flex scanner.  That scanner is running out of buffer
     space when it tries to unput() the humongous macro you've defined.  When
     you remove the '/'s, you make it small enough so that it fits in the buffer;
     removing spaces would do the same thing.
     
     The fix is to either rethink how come you're using such a big macro and
     perhaps there's another/better way to do it; or to rebuild flex's own
     scan.c with a larger value for
     
     	#define YY_BUF_SIZE 16384
