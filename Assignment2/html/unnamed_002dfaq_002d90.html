     The second of these will have to scan the entire input stream (because
     "(.|\n)*" matches an arbitrary amount of any text) in order to see if
     it ends with "*/", terminating the comment.  That potentially will overflow
     the input buffer.

     You can't use the '/' operator inside parentheses.  It's not clear
     what "(a/b)*" actually means.

     Single-rule is nice but will always have the problem of either setting
     restrictions on comments (like not allowing multi-line comments) and/or
     running the risk of consuming the entire input stream, as noted above.
