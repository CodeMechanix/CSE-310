     Well, strictly speaking flex isn't part of the GNU project.  They just
     distribute it because no one's written a decent GPL'd lex replacement.
     So you should send bugs directly to me.  Those sent to the GNU folks
     sometimes find there way to me, but some may drop between the cracks.

     This is already mentioned in the manual:
     
     Finally, here's an example of how to  match  C-style  quoted
     strings using exclusive start conditions, including expanded
     escape sequences (but not including checking  for  a  string
     that's too long):
     
     The reason for not doing the overflow checking is that it will needlessly
     clutter up an example whose main purpose is just to demonstrate how to
     use flex.
     
     The latest release is 2.5.4, by the way, available from ftp.ee.lbl.gov.
