<h3 class="section">A.3 M4 Dependency</h3>

<p><a name="index-m4-499"></a>The macro processor <code>m4</code><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
must be installed wherever flex is installed. 
<code>flex</code> invokes &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m4</span></samp>&rsquo;, found by searching the directories in the
<code>PATH</code> environment variable. Any code you place in section 1 or in the
actions will be sent through m4. Please follow these rules to protect your
code from unwanted <code>m4</code> processing.

     <ul>
<li>Do not use symbols that begin with, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m4_</span></samp>&rsquo;, such as, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m4_define</span></samp>&rsquo;,
or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m4_include</span></samp>&rsquo;, since those are reserved for <code>m4</code> macro names. If for
some reason you need m4_ as a prefix, use a preprocessor #define to get your
symbol past m4 unmangled.

     <li>Do not use the strings &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[[</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]]</span></samp>&rsquo; anywhere in your code. The
former is not valid in C, except within comments and strings, but the latter is valid in
code such as <code>x[y[z]]</code>. The solution is simple. To get the literal string
<code>"]]"</code>, use <code>"]""]"</code>. To get the array notation <code>x[y[z]]</code>,
use <code>x[y[z] ]</code>. Flex will attempt to detect these sequences in user code, and
escape them. However, it's best to avoid this complexity where possible, by
removing such sequences from your code.

   </ul>

   <p><code>m4</code> is only required at the time you run <code>flex</code>. The generated
scanner is ordinary C or C++, and does <em>not</em> require <code>m4</code>.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> The use of m4 is subject to change in
future revisions of flex. It is not part of the public API of flex. Do not depend on it.</p>
