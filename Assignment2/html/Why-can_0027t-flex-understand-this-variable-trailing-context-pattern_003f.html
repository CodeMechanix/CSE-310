     Your problem is that some of the definitions in the scanner use the '/'
     trailing context operator, and have it enclosed in ()'s.  Flex does not
     allow this operator to be enclosed in ()'s because doing so allows undefined
     regular expressions such as "(a/b)+".  So the solution is to remove the
     parentheses.  Note that you must also be building the scanner with the -l
     option for AT&amp;T lex compatibility.  Without this option, flex automatically
     encloses the definitions in parentheses.
