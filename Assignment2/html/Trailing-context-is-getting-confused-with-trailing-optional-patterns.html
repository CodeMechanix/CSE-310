     That should only happen with lex.  Flex can properly match this pattern.
     (That might be what you're saying, I'm just not sure.)

     Unfortunately, there's no easy way.  On the other hand, I don't see why
     it should be a problem.  Lex's matching is clearly wrong, and I'd hope
     that usually the intent remains the same as expressed with the pattern,
     so flex's matching will be correct.
