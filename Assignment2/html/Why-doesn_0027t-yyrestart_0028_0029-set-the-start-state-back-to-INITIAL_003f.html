<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Why doesn't yyrestart() set the start state back to INITIAL?</h3>

<p>There are two reasons.  The first is that there might
be programs that rely on the start state not changing across file changes. 
The second is that beginning with <code>flex</code> version 2.4, use of <code>yyrestart()</code> is no longer required,
so fixing the problem there doesn't solve the more general problem.
