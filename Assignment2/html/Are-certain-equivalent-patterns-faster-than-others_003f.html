     [Note, the most recent flex release is 2.5.4, which you can get from
     ftp.ee.lbl.gov.  It has bug fixes over 2.5.2 and 2.5.3.]

     These two are not equivalent.  For example, the first can match "footnote."
     but the second can only match "footnote".  This is almost certainly the
     cause in the discrepancy - the slower scanner run is matching more tokens,
     and/or having to do more backing up.
     
     > 2. Which of these two are better: [Ff]oot or (F|f)oot ?
     
     From a performance point of view, they're equivalent (modulo presumably
     minor effects such as memory cache hit rates; and the presence of trailing
     context, see below).  From a space point of view, the first is slightly
     preferable.

     I can't tell from this example whether the trailing context is variable-length
     or fixed-length (it could be the latter if {and} is fixed-length).  If it's
     variable length, which flex -p will tell you, then this reflects a basic
     performance problem, and if you can eliminate it by restructuring your
     scanner, you will see significant improvement.

     >    10 patterns and changed the rule to be 5 rules.
     >    This did compile, but what is the rule of thumb here ?
     
     The rule is to avoid trailing context other than fixed-length, in which for
     a/b, either the 'a' pattern or the 'b' pattern have a fixed length.  Use
     of the '|' operator automatically makes the pattern variable length, so in
     this case '[Ff]oot' is preferred to '(F|f)oot'.
     
     > 4. I changed a rule that looked like this:
     >    &lt;snext8>{and}{bb}/{ROMAN}[^A-Za-z] { BEGIN...
     >
     >    to the next 2 rules:
     >    &lt;snext8>{and}{bb}/{ROMAN}[A-Za-z] { ECHO;}
     >    &lt;snext8>{and}{bb}/{ROMAN}         { BEGIN...
     >
     >    Again, I understand the using [^...] will cause a great performance loss
     
     Actually, it doesn't cause any sort of performance loss.  It's a surprising
     fact about regular expressions that they always match in linear time
     regardless of how complex they are.
     
     >    but are there any specific rules about it ?
     
     See the "Performance Considerations" section of the man page, and also
     the example in MISC/fastwc/.
