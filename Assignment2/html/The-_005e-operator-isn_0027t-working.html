     I can't get this problem to reproduce - it works fine for me.  Note
     though that if what you have is slightly different:
     
     	COMMENT	^\*.*
     	%%
     	{COMMENT}	{ }
     
     then it won't work, because flex pushes back macro definitions enclosed
     in ()'s, so the rule becomes
     
     	(^\*.*)		{ }
     
     and now that the '^' operator is not at the immediate beginning of the
     line, it's interpreted as just a regular character.  You can avoid this
     behavior by using the "-l" lex-compatibility flag, or "%option lex-compat".
