<h3 class="section">How do I use my own I/O classes in a C++ scanner?</h3>

<p>When the flex C++ scanning class rewrite finally happens, then this sort of thing should become much easier.

   <p><a name="index-LexerOutput_002c-overriding-481"></a><a name="index-LexerInput_002c-overriding-482"></a><a name="index-overriding-LexerOutput-483"></a><a name="index-overriding-LexerInput-484"></a><a name="index-customizing-I_002fO-in-C_002b_002b-scanners-485"></a><a name="index-C_002b_002b-I_002fO_002c-customizing-486"></a>You can do this by passing the various functions (such as <code>LexerInput()</code>
and <code>LexerOutput()</code>) NULL <code>iostream*</code>'s, and then
dealing with your own I/O classes surreptitiously (i.e., stashing them in
special member variables).  This works because the only assumption about
the lexer regarding what's done with the iostream's is that they're
ultimately passed to <code>LexerInput()</code> and <code>LexerOutput</code>, which then do whatever
is necessary with them.
