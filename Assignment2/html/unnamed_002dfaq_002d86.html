     The Makefile in the distribution builds it, so you should have it.
     It's exceedingly trivial, just a main() that calls yylex() and
     a yyrap() that always returns 1.

     You can't indent your rules like this - that's where the errors are coming
     from.  Flex copies indented text to the output file, it's how you do things
     like
     
     	int num_lines_seen = 0;
     
     to declare local variables.
