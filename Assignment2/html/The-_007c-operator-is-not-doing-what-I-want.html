     The problem is that if you use '|' as a regular expression operator, for
     example "a|b" meaning "match either 'a' or 'b'", then it must *not* have
     any blanks around it.  If you instead want the special '|' *action* (which
     from your scanner appears to be the case), which is a way of giving two
     different rules the same action:
     
     	foo	|
     	bar	matched_foo_or_bar();
     
     then '|' *must* be separated from the first rule by whitespace and *must*
     be followed by a new line.  You *cannot* write it as:
     
     	foo | bar	matched_foo_or_bar();
     
     even though you might think you could because yacc supports this syntax.
     The reason for this unfortunately incompatibility is historical, but it's
     unlikely to be changed.
     
     Your problems with start condition scope are simply due to syntax errors
     from your use of '|' later confusing flex.
     
     Let me know if you still have problems.
