<pre class="example"><pre class="verbatim">     QUESTION:
     When was flex born?
     
     Vern Paxson took over
     the Software Tools lex project from Jef Poskanzer in 1982.  At that point it
     was written in Ratfor.  Around 1987 or so, Paxson translated it into C, and
     a legend was born :-).
