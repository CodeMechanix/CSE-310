     The BEGIN macro modifies the yy_start variable.  For C scanners, this
     is a static with scope visible through the whole file.  For C++ scanners,
     it's a member variable, so it only has visible scope within a member
     function.  Your lexbegin() routine is not a member function when you
     build a C++ scanner, so it's not modifying the correct yy_start.  The
     diagnostic that indicates this is that you found you needed to add
     a declaration of yy_start in order to get your scanner to compile when
     using C++; instead, the correct fix is to make lexbegin() a member
     function (by deriving from yyFlexLexer).
