     Since you have variable trailing context, this is a bigger performance
     problem.  Fixing it is usually easier than fixing backing up, which in a
     complicated scanner (yours seems to fit the bill) can be extremely
     difficult to do correctly.
     
     You also don't mention what flags you are using for your scanner.
     -f makes a large speed difference, and -Cfe buys you nearly as much
     speed but the resulting scanner is considerably smaller.

     -p should have reported this.
     
     > Is changing one of them to fixed-length is enough ?
     
     Yes.
     
     > Is it possible to change the 32,000 states limit ?
     
     Yes.  I've appended instructions on how.  Before you make this change,
     though, you should think about whether there are ways to fundamentally
     simplify your scanner - those are certainly preferable!

     To increase the 32K limit (on a machine with 32 bit integers), you increase
     the magnitude of the following in flexdef.h:
     
     #define JAMSTATE -32766 /* marks a reference to the state that always jams */
     #define MAXIMUM_MNS 31999
     #define BAD_SUBSCRIPT -32767
     #define MAX_SHORT 32700
     
     Adding a 0 or two after each should do the trick.
