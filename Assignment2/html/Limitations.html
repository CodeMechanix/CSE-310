<h2 class="chapter">24 Limitations</h2>

<p><a name="index-limitations-of-flex-479"></a>
Some trailing context patterns cannot be properly matched and generate
warning messages (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">dangerous trailing context</span></samp>&rsquo;).  These are
patterns where the ending of the first part of the rule matches the
beginning of the second part, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">zx*/xy*</span></samp>&rsquo;, where the 'x*'
matches the 'x' at the beginning of the trailing context.  (Note that
the POSIX draft states that the text matched by such patterns is
undefined.)  For some trailing context rules, parts which are actually
fixed-length are not recognized as such, leading to the abovementioned
performance loss.  In particular, parts using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{n}</span></samp>&rsquo;
(such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo{3}</span></samp>&rsquo;) are always considered variable-length. 
Combining trailing context with the special &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo; action can result
in <em>fixed</em> trailing context being turned into the more expensive
<em>variable</em> trailing context.  For example, in the following:

   <p><a name="index-warning_002c-dangerous-trailing-context-480"></a>
<pre class="example"><pre class="verbatim">         %%
         abc      |
         xyz/def
</pre>
</pre>
   <p>Use of <code>unput()</code> invalidates yytext and yyleng, unless the
<code>%array</code> directive or the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-l</span></samp>&rsquo; option has been used. 
Pattern-matching of <code>NUL</code>s is substantially slower than matching
other characters.  Dynamic resizing of the input buffer is slow, as it
entails rescanning all the text matched so far by the current (generally
huge) token.  Due to both buffering of input and read-ahead, you cannot
intermix calls to <samp><span class="file">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span></samp> routines, such as, <b>getchar()</b>,
with <code>flex</code> rules and expect it to work.  Call <code>input()</code>
instead.  The total table entries listed by the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-v</span></samp>&rsquo; flag excludes
the number of table entries needed to determine what rule has been
matched.  The number of entries is equal to the number of DFA states if
the scanner does not use <code>REJECT</code>, and somewhat greater than the
number of states if it does.  <code>REJECT</code> cannot be used with the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-f</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-F</span></samp>&rsquo; options.

   <p>The <code>flex</code> internal algorithms need documentation.
