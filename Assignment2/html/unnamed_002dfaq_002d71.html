     One way to do this is to have the parser call a stub routine that's
     included in the scanner's .l file, and consequently that has access ot
     BEGIN.  The only ugliness is that the parser can't pass in the state
     it wants, because those aren't visible - but if you don't have many
     such states, then using a different set of names doesn't seem like
     to much of a burden.
     
     While generating a .h file like you suggests is certainly cleaner,
     flex development has come to a virtual stand-still :-(, so a workaround
     like the above is much more pragmatic than waiting for a new feature.
