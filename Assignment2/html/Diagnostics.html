<p><a name="index-error-reporting_002c-diagnostic-messages-476"></a><a name="index-warnings_002c-diagnostic-messages-477"></a>
The following is a list of <code>flex</code> diagnostic messages:

     <ul>
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">warning, rule cannot be matched</span></samp>&rsquo; indicates that the given rule
cannot be matched because it follows other rules that will always match
the same text as it.  For example, in the following &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo; cannot be
matched because it comes after an identifier &ldquo;catch-all&rdquo; rule:

     <p><a name="index-warning_002c-rule-cannot-be-matched-478"></a>
     <pre class="example">     <pre class="verbatim">              [a-z]+    got_identifier();
              foo       got_foo();
     </pre>
</pre>
     <p>Using <code>REJECT</code> in a scanner suppresses this warning.

     <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">warning, -s option given but default rule can be matched</span></samp>&rsquo; means
that it is possible (perhaps only in a particular start condition) that
the default rule (match any single character) is the only one that will
match a particular input.  Since &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-s</span></samp>&rsquo; was given, presumably this is
not intended.

     <li><code>reject_used_but_not_detected undefined</code> or
<code>yymore_used_but_not_detected undefined</code>. These errors can occur
at compile time.  They indicate that the scanner uses <code>REJECT</code> or
<code>yymore()</code> but that <code>flex</code> failed to notice the fact, meaning
that <code>flex</code> scanned the first two sections looking for occurrences
of these actions and failed to find any, but somehow you snuck some in
(via a #include file, for example).  Use <code>%option reject</code> or
<code>%option yymore</code> to indicate to <code>flex</code> that you really do use
these features.

     <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">flex scanner jammed</span></samp>&rsquo;. a scanner compiled with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-s</span></samp>&rsquo; has encountered an input string which wasn't matched by any of
its rules.  This error can also occur due to internal problems.

     <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">token too large, exceeds YYLMAX</span></samp>&rsquo;. your scanner uses <code>%array</code>
and one of its rules matched a string longer than the <code>YYLMAX</code>
constant (8K bytes by default).  You can increase the value by
#define'ing <code>YYLMAX</code> in the definitions section of your <code>flex</code>
input.

     <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">scanner requires -8 flag to use the character 'x'</span></samp>&rsquo;. Your scanner
specification includes recognizing the 8-bit character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">'x'</span></samp>&rsquo; and
you did not specify the -8 flag, and your scanner defaulted to 7-bit
because you used the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-Cf</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-CF</span></samp>&rsquo; table compression options. 
See the discussion of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-7</span></samp>&rsquo; flag, <a href="Scanner-Options.html#Scanner-Options">Scanner Options</a>, for
details.

     <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">flex scanner push-back overflow</span></samp>&rsquo;. you used <code>unput()</code> to push
back so much text that the scanner's buffer could not hold both the
pushed-back text and the current token in <code>yytext</code>.  Ideally the
scanner should dynamically resize the buffer in this case, but at
present it does not.

     <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">input buffer overflow, can't enlarge buffer because scanner uses
REJECT</span></samp>&rsquo;.  the scanner was working on matching an extremely large token
and needed to expand the input buffer.  This doesn't work with scanners
that use <code>REJECT</code>.

     <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fatal flex scanner internal error--end of buffer missed</span></samp>&rsquo;. This can
occur in a scanner which is reentered after a long-jump has jumped out
(or over) the scanner's activation frame.  Before reentering the
scanner, use:
     <pre class="example">     <pre class="verbatim">              yyrestart( yyin );
     </pre>
</pre>
     <p>or, as noted above, switch to using the C++ scanner class.

     <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">too many start conditions in &lt;&gt; construct!</span></samp>&rsquo;  you listed more start
conditions in a &lt;&gt; construct than exist (so you must have listed at
least one of them twice). 
</ul>
