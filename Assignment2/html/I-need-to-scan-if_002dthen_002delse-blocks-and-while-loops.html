     I strongly advise you to instead build a parse tree (abstract syntax tree)
     and loop over that instead.  You'll find this has major benefits in keeping
     your interpreter simple and extensible.
     
     That said, the functionality you mention for get_position and set_position
     have been on the to-do list for a while.  As flex is a purely spare-time
     project for me, no guarantees when this will be added (in particular, it
     for sure won't be for many months to come).
