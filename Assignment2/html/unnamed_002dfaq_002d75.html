     So there are several problems.
     
     First, to go fast, you want to match as much text as possible, which
     your scanners don't in the case that what they're scanning is *not*
     a &lt;RN> tag.  So you want a rule like:
     
     	[^&lt;]+
     
     Second, C++ scanners are particularly slow if they're interactive,
     which they are by default.  Using -B speeds it up by a factor of 3-4
     on my workstation.
     
     Third, C++ scanners that use the istream interface are slow, because
     of how poorly implemented istream's are.  I built two versions of
     the following scanner:
     
     	%%
     	.*\n
     	.*
     	%%
     
     and the C version inhales a 2.5MB file on my workstation in 0.8 seconds.
     The C++ istream version, using -B, takes 3.8 seconds.
