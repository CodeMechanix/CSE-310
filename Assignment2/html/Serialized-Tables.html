<h2 class="chapter">22 Serialized Tables</h2>

<p><a name="index-serialization-462"></a><a name="index-memory_002c-serialized-tables-463"></a>
<a name="serialization"></a>A <code>flex</code> scanner has the ability to save the DFA tables to a file, and
load them at runtime when needed.  The motivation for this feature is to reduce
the runtime memory footprint.  Traditionally, these tables have been compiled into
the scanner as C arrays, and are sometimes quite large.  Since the tables are
compiled into the scanner, the memory used by the tables can never be freed. 
This is a waste of memory, especially if an application uses several scanners,
but none of them at the same time.

   <p>The serialization feature allows the tables to be loaded at runtime, before
scanning begins. The tables may be discarded when scanning is finished.
