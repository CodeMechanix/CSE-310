     All of the things you're wondering about, by the way, concerning flex
     internals - probably the only person who understands what they mean in
     English is me!  So I wouldn't worry too much about getting them right.
     That said ...

     Yes - prototypes of state compression tables.

     There is a scheme in the Aho/Sethi/Ullman compiler book for compressing
     scanner tables.  It involves creating two pairs of tables.  The first has
     "base" and "default" entries, the second has "next" and "check" entries.
     The "base" entry is indexed by the current state and yields an index into
     the next/check table.  The "default" entry gives what to do if the state
     transition isn't found in next/check.  The "next" entry gives the next
     state to enter, but only if the "check" entry verifies that this entry is
     correct for the current state.  Flex creates templates of series of
     next/check entries and then encodes differences from these templates as a
     way to compress the tables.

     See above.
