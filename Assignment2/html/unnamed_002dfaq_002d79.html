     Hmmm, you shouldn't increase MAX_SHORT, though looking through my email
     archives I see that I did indeed recommend doing so.  Try setting it back
     to 32700; that should suffice that you no longer need -Ca.  If it still
     hangs, then the interesting question is - where?

     Since Linux comes with source code, you should diff it against what
     you have to see what problems they missed.

     No, definitely not.  It's meant to be for those situations where you
     absolutely must squeeze every last cycle out of your scanner.
