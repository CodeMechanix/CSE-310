     Using the longjmp() function while inside yylex() or a routine called by it.
     
     > what is the flex activation frame.
     
     Just yylex()'s stack frame.

     No, yyrestart() doesn't imply a rewind, even though its name might sound
     like it does.  It tells the scanner to flush its internal buffers and
     start reading from the given file at its present location.
