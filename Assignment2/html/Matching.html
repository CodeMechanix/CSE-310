<h2 class="chapter">7 How the Input Is Matched</h2>

<p><a name="index-patterns_002c-matching-79"></a><a name="index-input_002c-matching-80"></a><a name="index-trailing-context_002c-matching-81"></a><a name="index-matching_002c-and-trailing-context-82"></a><a name="index-matching_002c-length-of-83"></a><a name="index-matching_002c-multiple-matches-84"></a>When the generated scanner is run, it analyzes its input looking for
strings which match any of its patterns.  If it finds more than one
match, it takes the one matching the most text (for trailing context
rules, this includes the length of the trailing part, even though it
will then be returned to the input).  If it finds two or more matches of
the same length, the rule listed first in the <code>flex</code> input file is
chosen.

   <p><a name="index-token-85"></a><a name="index-yytext-86"></a><a name="index-yyleng-87"></a>Once the match is determined, the text corresponding to the match
(called the <dfn>token</dfn>) is made available in the global character
pointer <code>yytext</code>, and its length in the global integer
<code>yyleng</code>.  The <dfn>action</dfn> corresponding to the matched pattern is
then executed (see <a href="Actions.html#Actions">Actions</a>), and then the remaining input is scanned
for another match.

   <p><a name="index-default-rule-88"></a>If no match is found, then the <dfn>default rule</dfn> is executed: the next
character in the input is considered matched and copied to the standard
output.  Thus, the simplest valid <code>flex</code> input is:

   <p><a name="index-minimal-scanner-89"></a>
<pre class="example"><pre class="verbatim">         %%
</pre>
</pre>
   <p>which generates a scanner that simply copies its input (one character at
a time) to its output.

   <p><a name="index-yytext_002c-two-types-of-90"></a><a name="index-g_t_0025array_002c-use-of-91"></a><a name="index-g_t_0025pointer_002c-use-of-92"></a><a name="index-yytext-93"></a>Note that <code>yytext</code> can be defined in two different ways: either as
a character <em>pointer</em> or as a character <em>array</em>. You can
control which definition <code>flex</code> uses by including one of the
special directives <code>%pointer</code> or <code>%array</code> in the first
(definitions) section of your flex input.  The default is
<code>%pointer</code>, unless you use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-l</span></samp>&rsquo; lex compatibility option,
in which case <code>yytext</code> will be an array.  The advantage of using
<code>%pointer</code> is substantially faster scanning and no buffer overflow
when matching very large tokens (unless you run out of dynamic memory). 
The disadvantage is that you are restricted in how your actions can
modify <code>yytext</code> (see <a href="Actions.html#Actions">Actions</a>), and calls to the <code>unput()</code>
function destroys the present contents of <code>yytext</code>, which can be a
considerable porting headache when moving between different <code>lex</code>
versions.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0025array_002c-advantages-of-94"></a>The advantage of <code>%array</code> is that you can then modify <code>yytext</code>
to your heart's content, and calls to <code>unput()</code> do not destroy
<code>yytext</code> (see <a href="Actions.html#Actions">Actions</a>).  Furthermore, existing <code>lex</code>
programs sometimes access <code>yytext</code> externally using declarations of
the form:

<pre class="example"><pre class="verbatim">         extern char yytext[];
</pre>
</pre>
   <p>This definition is erroneous when used with <code>%pointer</code>, but correct
for <code>%array</code>.

   <p>The <code>%array</code> declaration defines <code>yytext</code> to be an array of
<code>YYLMAX</code> characters, which defaults to a fairly large value.  You
can change the size by simply #define'ing <code>YYLMAX</code> to a different
value in the first section of your <code>flex</code> input.  As mentioned
above, with <code>%pointer</code> yytext grows dynamically to accommodate
large tokens.  While this means your <code>%pointer</code> scanner can
accommodate very large tokens (such as matching entire blocks of
comments), bear in mind that each time the scanner must resize
<code>yytext</code> it also must rescan the entire token from the beginning,
so matching such tokens can prove slow.  <code>yytext</code> presently does
<em>not</em> dynamically grow if a call to <code>unput()</code> results in too
much text being pushed back; instead, a run-time error results.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0025array_002c-with-C_002b_002b-95"></a>Also note that you cannot use <code>%array</code> with C++ scanner classes
(see <a href="Cxx.html#Cxx">Cxx</a>).
