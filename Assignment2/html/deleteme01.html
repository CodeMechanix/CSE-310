     Subject: Re: Flex / Unicode compatibility question

     Unfortunately flex at the moment has a widespread assumption within it
     that characters are processed 8 bits at a time.  I don't see any easy
     fix for this (other than writing your rules in terms of double characters -
     a pain).  I also don't know of a wider lex, though you might try surfing
     the Plan 9 stuff because I know it's a Unicode system, and also the PCCT
     toolkit (try searching say Alta Vista for "Purdue Compiler Construction
     Toolkit").
     
     Fixing flex to handle wider characters is on the long-term to-do list.
     But since flex is a strictly spare-time project these days, this probably
     won't happen for quite a while, unless someone else does it first.
